# _pa WordPress theme

This is being actively developed. Plenty of things are not done yet. Do not use this theme in production. It's a B A D idea. 

## Description

Speed- & Content-centric theme. It's not made for anyone but me. Use, abuse, remix and change all you want, but you'll be on your own. This is not a theme you'll install, set and forget. In order to get it to work the way you want to, you need to tinker. And you need CodeKit. Why? Because I can't be bothered with using Gulp.

It's based off of [_s](https://underscores.me/) in order to save a day of work.

## Notes

- I have not cared in the slightest about checking compatibility with older WordPress versions or PHP below 7.3. Feel free to test if you want, but I won't make changes to accomodate lower versions - because why?
- There are code comments scattered around, but it's far from complete.
- I do not like (nay - I HATE) the 'endif', 'endwhile' format. It breaks my visual way of thinking and so all instances of that have been removed. A PR that contains such things, will be denied.

### Customization

Yea. There'll be a lot of that.

## Usage

If I have to explain how to install a WP theme, this isn't for you.
